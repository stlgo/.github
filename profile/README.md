## Hello fellow Gophers! ðŸ‘‹

We are the [St. Louis Go(lang) Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/StL-Go/) group, part of the [GoBridge Developer Network](https://github.com/gobridge/about-us/blob/master/README.md).

Prior to _COVID-era_, we met in person on the fourth Wednesday of each month for development-oriented presentations and discussion centered on the [Go Programming language](https://go.dev/).

Now, we still get together, but virtually. This also means we can invite our friends from all over the world! 

> Everyone is welcome! We try to make sure that folks of all skill-levels can get something out of our talks, so please don't be shy! We believe _learning in public_ is the best way for us to all learn together.
